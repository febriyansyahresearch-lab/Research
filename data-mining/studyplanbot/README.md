# StudyPlanBot

StudyPlanBot is an academic chatbot designed to assist students with
study planning and academic consultation.  
This project was developed as part of a **Data Mining** coursework
for the **Master’s program in Information Technology (MTI)**.

The chatbot demonstrates how simple data mining logic can be applied
to support academic decision-making without using external APIs.
